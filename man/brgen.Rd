\description{
The Bernoulli distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability  p and the value 0 with probability  q=1-p.This distribution is a special case of the Binomial distribution where a single experiment/trial is conducted (n=1).

\arguments{
	\item{p}{
p as the probability of success in the trial.

\details{
The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution with n=1. The probability distribution of any single experiment that asks a yesâ€“no question; the question results in a boolean-valued outcome, a single bit of information whose value is success/yes/true/one with probability p and failure/no/false/zero with probability q.
}
\value{
The returned value is a boolean variable, having either True/1 of False/0 value, representing success or failure of the trial conducted.
